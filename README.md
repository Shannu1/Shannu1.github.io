# Personal Web Resume Project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Created with a idea of updating my PDF resume anywhere anytime. I have created this project as part of my React application replicating my MS Word template.
Added with interactive features and modals to the resume.
Added print button for print shortcut.

By this I just have to update the experience.json to make changes whenever required.
